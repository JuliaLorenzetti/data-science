# difference btw numpy array and panda dataframe
# df is richer version of array. numpy for math, panda for data manipulation

# retrieve indices of objects that fulfil boolean expression
import numpy as np
a = np.array([-1,2,3,5])
abol = (a<0)
np.all(abol)
np.where(abol)

# advantage of list over array: can contain any object (text, number..) array only one. list is however slower
